# Spellbook
A standalone variant of the larger BookKeeper application which isolates the UserSpellWindow as the launch application.

Due to the difficulty of pulling in only the absolutely necessary classes and dependencies, Spellbook actually contains all of the files necessary for BookKeeper. But since it's closed source and the main window can't be called by a subwindow, I don't really care. 

To use this software:

1) Download all of the files and put them in a folder.

2) Wew lad, you did it.

To Do:
* Spell slots
