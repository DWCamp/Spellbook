# Spellbook v1.1.0
Spellbook is an application by a grumpy DM who was tired of his players not remembering their spells. It includes:
* A digital spellbook. Add, remove, prepare, and keep the details handy for every spell you could ever want.
* A searchable 5e spell database. This includes all cannonical spells according to this website: http://ephe.github.io/grimoire/. Users can search all spells or narrow their entry. For example, you can search for all wizard Level 3 evocation spells with "fire" in the description (Fireball, Melf's Minute Meteors, and Wall of Water, apparently).

Make sure to keep all the files in the same folder

v1.1.0 release notes
-------------------------
* Open sourced! So that's a thing
* Dynamic resolution scaling. For all those 4K monitors.

**Known bugs** 
* System font on macOS is making the window look a little screwy. Still functional, though.
* Minor text issues on screens of lower resolution than 1080p
