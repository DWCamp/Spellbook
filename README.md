# Spellbook
A standalone variant of the larger BookKeeper application which isolates the UserSpellWindow as the launch application.

Due to the difficulty of pulling in only the absolutely necessary classes and dependencies, Spellbook actually contains all of the files necessary for UserSpellWindow. But since it's closed source and the main window can't be called by a subwindow, I don't really care. 

To use this software, simply download it. Certain features will not work (notably "only show spells I can learn") but who really gives a shit.

To Do:
Spell slots
