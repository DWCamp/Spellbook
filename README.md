# Spellbook
Spellbook is an application by a grumpy DM who was tired of his players not remembering their spells. It is:
* A searchable 5e spell database. This includes all cannonical spells according to this website: http://ephe.github.io/grimoire/
* Digital spellbook. Add, remove, prepare, and keep the details handy for every spell you could ever want.
