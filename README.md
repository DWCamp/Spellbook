# Spellbook v1.0.0
Spellbook is an application by a grumpy DM who was tired of his players not remembering their spells. It includes:
* A digital spellbook. Add, remove, prepare, and keep the details handy for every spell you could ever want.
* A searchable 5e spell database. This includes all cannonical spells according to this website: http://ephe.github.io/grimoire/. Users can search all spells or narrow their entry. For example, you can search for all wizard Level 3 evocation spells with "fire" in the description (Fireball, Melf's Minute Meteors, and Wall of Water, apparently).

Installation instructions:

1) Download the zip file containing this project

2) Unzip it.

3) Optional step: Create a shortcut to the jar file so you can bury the folder and have a nice, pretty icon on your desktop.

Make sure to keep all the files in the same folder

**WARNING:** Hoooooooly crap is this a very tentative 1.0. It won't break your computer or anything, but it might have some bugs. I've hit this thing with a hammer 7 ways to Sunday but when it's one guy making a entire application like this, especially one that's very data centric, it's easy to have a bug slip through the gaps. I gave a beta to my party after I cobbled the thing together and within 30 seconds my wizard already found a major bug. So, if there are serious issues, I'm sorry. Please tell me about them and I will fix them as soon as I can.

As of right now, the only known issue is that the system font on macOS is making the window look a little screwy. Still functional, though.
